**About Scratch**
Scratch is a creative programming language and the world’s largest online coding community for
children and teens. Children around the world use Scratch and ScratchJr to create their own
interactive games, stories, and animations – and share their creations with one another. In the
process, they learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. So far in 2024,
more than 14 million young people around the world have joined Scratch, more than 106 million new
projects have been created, and more than 500,000 new projects are made each day!
